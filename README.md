# ExerciseLogger:
An interactive jupyter-notebook helper that keeps track of your exercises and more!

## Why?
Keeping track of your workouts, progression and eventual setbacks are not only key for both boosting motivation and increasing progression, 
but (if you are like me and your mind is chaotic and messy) also essential when planning future exercises.
Alot of the apps/tools I have found that are supposed to help you keep track of your exercising are messy and lack simplicity. 
They often include tons of unnessecary information and options, which may be helpful, but is more than not overwhelming.
This program gives the user alot of freedom, with some presets created for the unexperienced "gym-bros". Welcome if this is you![^1] 


[^1]: (I am by no means a self-proclaimed professional gym-bro, but I do feel like I know my way around my own workout routine).

## Built-in tools (these may be work in progress):
- Create a profile of you, your partner, or whoever wants to use this. Track bodyweight. Possibly sleep and mood in the future.
- Ability to set up profiles for single exercises or workout routines.
- Tracking and graphing progress on exercises or routines.

Note: All data is stored on your own computer, none of it is sent to me.
